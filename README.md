# Zero-Robotics-2018-Tournament
Code used to run the SPHERES in the ISS simulation.

The Zero Robotics High School Tournament consists of five main stages:

1- Application
2- 2D simulation practice run
3- 3D simulation competition
4- Alliance formation and semi-finals simulation competition
5- ISS Finals

The contest begins with several simulation competitions held online at the Zero Robotics website that gradually increase in difficulty. Finalists from the online simulation phase will proceed to the ISS, where an astronaut conducts a live competition with the SPHERES satellites and in microgravity! This final ISS event will be hosted simultaneously at MIT, an ESA site and the University of Sydney with special audio/video links.

The Zero Robotics High School Tournament 2018 (the “Tournament”) is run by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Space Systems Laboratory, 70 Vassar St., Cambridge, MA 02139 (“MIT”). The tournament is sponsored by CASIS and ESA; in addition CASIS provides the agreements for use of the ISS.
